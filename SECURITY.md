As a Cyber Security Specialist, I take security very seriously. Please be aware that this program can execute various inspector modules, which means that potentially malicious scripts could be run if not properly managed. I am not responsible for any damage or loss of files that may occur in such cases.

To maintain a secure environment, please follow these best practices:

- **Use Least Privilege**: Audit with an account that has only the necessary privileges for the audit. Avoid using accounts with excessive permissions.
- **Write-Protect the Inspector Folder**: Ensure that the inspector folder is write-protected to prevent unauthorized access and to safeguard against malicious code being inserted.
- **Avoid Untrusted Scripts**: Do not place any PowerShell scripts in the inspector folder unless they are from a trusted source.
