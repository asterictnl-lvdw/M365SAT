Guest access has three levels of restriction. 1. Guest users have the same access as members (most inclusive)  2. Guest users have limited access to properties and memberships of directory objects 3. Guest user access is restricted to properties and memberships of their own directory objects The recommended option is the 3rd, most restrictive: 'Guest user access is restricted to their own directory object'"
